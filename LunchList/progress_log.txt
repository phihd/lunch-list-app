7.4.2020
*A few lines of description of what classes have been added or updated and what functions have been implemented in them (even if they were not ready yet)
- An usable GUI (with favourite dish tick, ingredient and allergens filter, day selection included)
- Added 2 more restaurant that's still working during corona virus Maukas and Taffa, data from https://kanttiinit.fi/
- "User" class added to save the data of properties, allergens, favourite courses
- "Restaurant" has been adjusted for GUI implementation
- Other "restaurant" has been slightly adjusted as well
*What methods / functionality have been tested so far in classes so that they work properly?
- GUI has been tested by trying all features and see the results, and errors have been fixed if any.

*What possible difficult errors have occurred and have they been resolved?
- Allergen and property filter worked inaccurately due to wrong code of the part when choosing suitable courses to display in the menu.
Status: resolved
- There are some json menu on the website that do not separate "title" and "properties". Some even doesn't have properties => bugs
  Example: Title: "Red curry with chicken G, M, VS"
           Properties: ""
           Title: "Days salad portion (changes daily)"
           Properties: ""
Status: resolved
- Some notification such as "No menu available." or "No course found." also has check boxes to select for favourite courses
Status: resolved 

*What is the workload used during this time with 5 hours accuracy
60 hours
